  <what-built>
    Complete catalog storefront with:
    - Homepage with hero banner and product grid (infinite scroll)
    - Product detail page with related products
    - Category filter chips
    - Search bar with debounced instant search
    - Sort dropdown (newest, price, name)
    - Seed data with ~50 electronics products
    - Apple Store-inspired clean aesthetic
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Start the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet run --project code/MicroCommerce.AppHost
    ```

    Then verify each requirement:

    1. **INFRA-01 - Seed Data:** Check the database has ~50 products across multiple categories (they should appear automatically on first run)

    2. **CAT-01 - Browse Products:** Visit the homepage (http://localhost:XXXX). Verify:
       - Hero banner shows at top
       - Product grid shows below with product cards (image, name, price, category badge)
       - Scroll down to trigger infinite scroll loading more products
       - Cards have hover effect with Add to Cart overlay

    3. **CAT-02 - Product Detail:** Click any product card. Verify:
       - Detail page shows large image, name, price, description, category, SKU
       - "Add to Cart" button shows toast "Cart coming soon!"
       - Related products from same category appear below
       - Back button returns to grid with filter state preserved

    4. **CAT-03 - Category Filter:** On homepage, click a category chip. Verify:
       - Grid shows only products from that category
       - URL updates with category parameter
       - Click "All" to clear filter

    5. **CAT-04 - Search:** Type "laptop" in search bar. Verify:
       - Results update after brief debounce
       - Only matching products shown
       - Clear search restores all products

    6. **Sort:** Change sort dropdown. Verify price low-to-high shows cheapest first.

    7. **Combined:** Search "pro" + filter by a category + sort by price. Verify all work together.
