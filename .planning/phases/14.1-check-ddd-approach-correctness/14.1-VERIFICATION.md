# Phase 14.1: Check DDD Approach Correctness Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Audit all DDD tactical patterns across the entire codebase and produce a structured findings report with severity-tagged issues, citing DDD principles and reference materials

**Verified:** 2026-02-13T19:35:50Z

**Status:** passed

**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | All 7 feature modules audited with equal scrutiny | ✓ VERIFIED | AUDIT-REPORT.md contains dedicated sections for all 7 modules (BuildingBlocks/Common, Catalog, Ordering, Cart, Inventory, Profiles, Reviews, Wishlists) with substantive findings per module |
| 2 | Bounded context isolation analyzed across the entire codebase | ✓ VERIFIED | Cross-Cutting Findings section includes "Bounded Context Isolation" with 6 findings (4 critical, 1 warning, 1 info) analyzing cross-context DbContext injection patterns |
| 3 | CQRS patterns validated across all modules | ✓ VERIFIED | Cross-Cutting Findings section includes "CQRS Patterns" with 5 findings (3 critical, 2 info) validating command return patterns across modules |
| 4 | Final report has executive summary with key findings | ✓ VERIFIED | AUDIT-REPORT.md line 7 contains "## Executive Summary" with systemic issues, pattern inconsistencies, positive observations, and remediation priorities |
| 5 | Each finding cites the DDD principle or reference material | ✓ VERIFIED | All 71 findings have "**Principle:**" (71 occurrences) and "**Reference:**" (71 occurrences) fields; References section lists 18 DDD sources |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `.planning/phases/14.1-check-ddd-approach-correctness/14.1-DDD-AUDIT-REPORT.md` | Complete DDD audit report with all 7 modules plus cross-cutting analysis | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists (472 lines, 40KB), contains Executive Summary (line 7), all 8 module sections, 4 cross-cutting sections, 71 severity-tagged findings, References section with 18 sources |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| 14.1-DDD-FINDINGS-WIP.md | 14.1-DDD-AUDIT-REPORT.md | WIP findings merged with remaining module audits into final report | ✓ WIRED | Catalog module findings in WIP file (10 findings) match AUDIT-REPORT exactly; WIP file has 292 lines with findings for BuildingBlocks/Common + first 3 modules + remaining 5 modules; final report consolidated all findings with cross-cutting analysis |

### Artifact Deep Verification

**Level 1 - Exists:** ✓ PASSED
- AUDIT-REPORT.md exists at expected path (472 lines, 40KB)

**Level 2 - Substantive:** ✓ PASSED
- Contains "## Executive Summary" at line 7 (required pattern)
- Contains all 8 expected module sections: BuildingBlocks/Common, Catalog, Ordering, Cart, Inventory, Profiles, Reviews, Wishlists
- Contains 4 cross-cutting sections: Bounded Context Isolation, CQRS Patterns, Ubiquitous Language, Pattern Consistency
- Contains 71 severity-tagged findings with structure: [Severity] Title, **Issue:**, **Principle:**, **Reference:**
- Contains References section with 18 DDD sources
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments found
- No empty Issue/Principle/Reference fields found
- Report format matches specification: severity levels (Critical/Warning/Info), issue-principle-reference structure, no before/after code examples

**Level 3 - Wired:** ✓ PASSED
- WIP findings properly merged: Catalog module has 10 identical findings in both WIP and AUDIT-REPORT
- Commits verified: 2cfe91b8 (Task 1: module audits), 5cf07233 (Task 2: final report)
- SUMMARY.md references AUDIT-REPORT.md as key file created
- SUMMARY.md metrics align with report content: 71 findings (21 critical, 26 warning, 24 info), 7 modules audited, 4 cross-cutting sections

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns detected. The audit report is substantive, well-structured, and complete.

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| N/A | N/A | None | N/A | No issues found |

### Findings Quality Samples

**Sample 1 - Critical finding with full structure:**
```
[Critical] Direct cross-context DbContext injection in Reviews module
- Issue: CreateReviewCommandHandler, UpdateReviewCommandHandler, DeleteReviewCommandHandler inject OrderingDbContext (purchase verification) and CatalogDbContext (product rating updates). Handlers directly query Orders table and mutate Product entity within the same handler transaction.
- Principle: Bounded contexts must maintain isolation; cross-context operations should use domain events or integration events, not direct database queries
- Reference: [Bounded Context - Martin Fowler], [Domain analysis for microservices - Azure]
- Impact: Reviews cannot be extracted to a separate service without major refactoring
```

**Sample 2 - Cross-cutting analysis:**
```
Bounded Context Isolation section contains:
- 4 Critical findings (Reviews DbContext injection, Wishlists DbContext injection, Ordering consumer mutates Inventory, cross-context category check)
- 1 Warning finding
- 1 Info finding
All with Issue/Principle/Reference structure
```

**Sample 3 - Module coverage verification:**
- Catalog: 10 findings (3 critical, 4 warning, 3 info)
- Cart: 6 findings (2 critical, 3 warning, 1 info)
- Inventory: 5 findings (1 critical, 3 warning, 1 info)
- Profiles: 5 findings (1 critical, 2 warning, 2 info)
- Reviews: 5 findings (2 critical, 1 warning, 2 info)
- Wishlists: 5 findings (2 critical, 2 warning, 1 info)
- All modules received equal depth of analysis across 8 pattern categories

### Executive Summary Quality

The executive summary meets all requirements:
- **Systemic issues identified:** Bounded context leakage, aggregate boundary violations, CQRS command return violations, strongly-typed ID inconsistency
- **Pattern inconsistencies:** v1.0 vs v1.1 module differences documented
- **Positive observations:** Acknowledges correct patterns (strongly-typed IDs, value objects, domain events, optimistic concurrency)
- **Remediation priorities:** 4-level priority structure (Critical → Warning)
- **No numeric scoring:** No health score or numeric metrics (per user decision)
- **Actionable:** Clear remediation path for future phases

## Verification Outcome

**All must-haves VERIFIED.** Phase 14.1 goal achieved.

The audit successfully:
1. Covered all 7 feature modules + BuildingBlocks/Common with equal scrutiny (71 findings across 8 modules)
2. Performed cross-cutting analysis on bounded context isolation, CQRS patterns, ubiquitous language, and pattern consistency
3. Delivered a complete, structured audit report with executive summary
4. Tagged all findings with severity (Critical/Warning/Info)
5. Cited DDD principles and reference materials for every finding (71/71 findings have Principle and Reference)
6. Identified systemic architectural issues (bounded context leakage, aggregate boundaries) vs. isolated tactical issues
7. Provided actionable remediation priorities for future phases

The deliverable (14.1-DDD-AUDIT-REPORT.md) is production-quality, substantive, and ready for use in planning remediation phases.
