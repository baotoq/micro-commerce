# Phase 14.1: Check DDD Approach Correctness - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Audit all DDD tactical patterns across the entire codebase — both the BuildingBlocks/Common primitives and how every feature module (Catalog, Cart, Ordering, Inventory, Profiles, Reviews, Wishlists) applies them. This phase produces a findings report. No code fixes — document only.

## Implementation Decisions

### Audit Scope
- Full audit of ALL DDD tactical patterns: aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events, repositories, bounded contexts, strongly-typed IDs
- Audit covers both the BuildingBlocks/Common layer (base classes like AggregateRoot, Entity, ValueObject, StronglyTypedId) AND how each feature module uses them
- All 7 feature modules audited with equal scrutiny: Catalog, Cart, Ordering, Inventory, Profiles, Reviews, Wishlists
- Bounded context isolation included — check for cross-context queries, shared models, domain knowledge leaking between feature modules
- CQRS patterns included — validate command/query separation, handler responsibilities, whether commands mutate through aggregates properly

### Correctness Standard
- Compare against modern .NET DDD references (eShopOnContainers, Clean Architecture, MediatR patterns)
- Check both structural/behavioral correctness AND naming/ubiquitous language consistency
- Flag deviations from established .NET community DDD best practices

### Action on Findings
- Document only — this phase produces a findings report, no code fixes
- Findings grouped by module, each tagged with severity: Critical (breaks DDD invariants), Warning (deviates from best practice), Info (could be improved)
- Describe the issue and the DDD principle violated — no before/after code examples
- Focus on issues only — do not document things done well

### Review Deliverable
- Structured markdown report in the phase directory: `.planning/phases/14.1-check-ddd-approach-correctness/`
- Executive summary with key findings but no numeric scoring
- Each finding cites the DDD principle or reference material (books, articles) that supports it

### Claude's Discretion
- Internal organization of the report beyond the module + severity structure
- Order of modules reviewed
- How deep to go on each module based on complexity found

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Reference standard is modern .NET DDD (eShopOnContainers, Ardalis, Clean Architecture patterns) — not strict Evans/Vernon orthodoxy
- The report should be actionable enough that a separate fix phase can work through findings module by module

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
