## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

Features explicitly deferred to future versions:

- [ ] User reviews and ratings
- [ ] Wishlist/favorites
- [ ] Email notifications

## Out of Scope

| Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Real payment processing | Mock payments sufficient for demo, avoids compliance burden |
| Event sourcing | Adds complexity without proportional demo value |
| Separate admin application | Integrated admin routes simpler, shared auth context |
| Mobile app | Web-first, responsive design covers mobile |
| Real-time chat/support | Not core to e-commerce demo |
| Multi-tenancy | Single store demonstration |
| Social login | Keycloak handles this if needed, not v1 priority |
